The base of the Linux/Unix file system hierarchy begins at the root and everything starts with the root directory. 

These are the common top-level directories associated with the root directory:
 /bin – binary or executable programs.
/etc – system configuration files.
/home – home directory. It is the default current directory.
/opt – optional or third-party software.
/tmp – temporary space, typically cleared on reboot.
/usr – User related programs.
/var – log files.
Some other directories in the Linux system:
/boot- It contains all the boot-related information files and folders such as conf, grub, etc.
/dev – It is the location of the device files such as dev/sda1, dev/sda2, etc.
/lib – It contains kernel modules and a shared library.
/lost+found – It is used to find recovered bits of corrupted files.
/media – It contains subdirectories where removal media devices inserted.
/mnt – It contains temporary mount directories for mounting the file system.
/proc – It is a virtual and pseudo-file system to contains info about the running processes with a specific process ID or PID.
/run – It stores volatile runtime data.
/sbin – binary executable programs for an administrator.
/srv – It contains server-specific and server-related files.
/sys – It is a virtual filesystem for modern Linux distributions to store and allows modification of the devices connected to the system.
Exploring directories and their usability:
We know that Linux is a very complex system that requires an efficient way to start, stop, maintain and reboot a system, unlike Windows operating system. In the Linux system some well-defined configuration files, binaries, man pages information files available for every process. 

Linux Kernel File:
/boot/vmlinux – The Linux kernel file.
Device Files:
/dev/hda – Device file for the first IDE HDD.
/dev/hdc – A pseudo-device that output garbage output is redirected to /dev/null.
System Configuration Files:
/etc/bashrc – It is used by bash shell that contains system defaults and aliases.
/etc/crontab – A shell script to run specified commands on a predefined time interval.
/etc/exports – It contains information on the file system available on the network.
/etc/fstab – Information of the Disk Drive and their mount point.
/etc/group – It is a text file to define Information of Security Group.
/etc/grub.conf – It is the grub bootloader configuration file.
/etc/init.d – Service startup Script.
/etc/lilo.conf – It contains lilo bootloader configuration file.
/etc/hosts – Information of IP and corresponding hostnames.
/etc/hosts.allow – It contains a list of hosts allowed accessing services on the local machine.
/etc/host.deny – List of hosts denied to access services on the local machine.
/etc/inittab – INIT process and their interaction at the various run level.
/etc/issue – Allows editing the pre-login message.
/etc/modules.conf – It contains the configuration files for the system modules.
/etc/motd – It contains the message of the day.
/etc/mtab – Currently mounted blocks information.
/etc/passwd – It contains username, password of the system, users in a shadow file.
/etc/printcap – It contains printer Information.
/etc/profile – Bash shell defaults.
/etc/profile.d –  It contains other scripts like application scripts, executed after login.
/etc/rc.d – It avoids script duplication.
/etc/rc.d/init.d – Run Level Initialisation Script.
/etc/resolv.conf – DNS being used by System.
/etc/security – It contains the name of terminals where root login is possible.
/etc/skel – Script that initiates new user home directory.
/etc/termcap – An ASCII file that defines the behavior of different types of the terminal.
/etc/X11 –  Directory tree contains all the conf files for the X-window System.
User Related Files:
/usr/bin – It contains most of the executable files.
/usr/bin/X11 – Symbolic link of /usr/bin.
/usr/include – It contains standard include files used by C program.
/usr/share – It contains architecture independent shareable text files.
/usr/lib – It contains object files and libraries.
/usr/sbin – It contains commands for Super User, for System Administration.
Virtual and Pseudo Process Related Files:
/proc/cpuinfo – CPU Information
/proc/filesystems – It keeps the useful info about the processes that are running currently.
/proc/interrupts – it keeps the information about the number of interrupts per IRQ.
/proc/ioports – Contains all the Input and Output addresses used by devices on the server.
/proc/meminfo –  It reports the memory usage information.
/proc/modules – Currently using kernel module.
/proc/mount – Mounted File-system Information.
/proc/stat –  It displays the detailed statistics of the current system.
/proc/swaps –  It contains swap file information.
Version Information File:
/version – It displays the Linux version information.
Log Files:
/var/log/lastlog – It stores user last login info.
/var/log/messages – It has all the global system messages.
/var/log/wtmp – It keeps a history of login and logout information.
